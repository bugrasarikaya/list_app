A project code [1] was utilized for supplying list and related product info, in list controller.
"HttpResponseException" method was found in a webpage [2] and it was used for responding with 404 HTTP status instead of 500 HTTP status.
3 project codes [1] [3] [4] were utilized for implementing AutoMapper.
"Ignore" and "DoNotValidate" statements which ignores propety for mapping, was found in 2 webpages [5] [6] and "DoNotValidate" method was used.
List product controller and repository classes were removed because their necessary content was moved into list classes.
409 Conflict HTTP status code was found in a webpage [7] and it was used while adding a record which is already exist.
String parameterized versions of list methods, were written but then they were commented becaus they were thought as redundant operations.
Status property was added to List entity.
In a webpage [8], it was learnt that Fluent Validation does not support validating primitive types.
Instead of using Fluent Validation, new static classes were written for validating manually.
Thanks to a webpage code, ModelState error messages were supplied.
Written static classes for validating, were changed to normal classes because it was thought that error messages from multiple validations, conflict.
