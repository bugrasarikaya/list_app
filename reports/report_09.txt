An attemp was started to fix NU1701 warning which is about not fully compatible "Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core" (v5.2.9) NuGet package.
Info about 418 HTTP status code which is a April Fools' joke, was read on a webpage [1].
Exception [2] and logging [3] middleware codes of a project, were copied.
Usages of multiple "catch" statements, were examiend on a document [4].
After reading a document [5] about custom exception, 2 custom exceptions were written for handling query exceptions.
Written exceptions were used instead of non-reliable "Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core" (System.Net and System.Web.Http libraries) methods.
Written exceptions were catched in custom exception middleware.
In custom exception middleware, "WriteAsync" method was used instead of "StartAsync" method for writing error message after examining a webpage [6].
Custom log file names were changed to report names.
For making a RESTful API and fixing Swagger conflict, HTTP Patch method was used instead of HTTP Get method for setting list to "Completed" status.
Any method for validating JsonPatchDocument by Fluent Validation, could not be found on internet.
A validation class with Fluent Validation, was written by benefiting 6 webpages [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12].
A new method was wrriten for checking name of record.
"Status" model was added.
Commented lines were removed.
Usage of optional parameters, was examined on 2 webpages [13] [14].
Supplier and checker methods were moved in another classes in created "Common" folder in "Repository" folder.
Supplier and checker methods were upgraded.
Difference between DTO and View Model, was read on a webpage [15].
By inspiring a webpage [16] code, DTO with in HTTP Patch body, was used intead of JsonPatchDocument.
Patch DTO class of "List" class was similar itself instead of a class which have name and value properties, because it was thought that specific properties cannot be validated programmaticaly for Patch DTO class which have name and value properties.
An validation warning text from a webpage [17], was benefited.
Input models were change their DTO versions.
Another model for roles, was added.
Token repository classes renamed as auth repository names.
Repository classes were upgraded but controller classes were not updated.
