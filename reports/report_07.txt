By examining a project [1], changings in "appsettings.json" and "Program.cs" were applied for injecting database and repository pattern.
Thanks to code of "Program.cs" from a project [2], an error about injecting database interface, was fixed.
Working on "Scoped", "Transient" and "Singleton" issues, was delayed.
A routing statement from a webpage [3], was applied for using multiple parameters.
It was detected that Swagger did not ignore some redundant model properties and some fixing methods were found but resolving this issue, was delayed.
2 videos [4] [5] about role based authorization with JWT, were watched.
By benefiting watched videos [4] [5] and a code [6] of watched video [5], a claim system was added into token handler.
"Must" method of fluent validation, was found in a webpage [7] and it was used for user role.
"Authorize" attributes with roles, were added by benefiting a document [8].
By benefiting 5 sources [9] [10] [11] [12] [13], a system was written to check user role and supply user ID.
Checking user role feature was removed and system was moved into created controller which is accessible only with "User" role.
A method from a webpage [14], was utilized for supplying records whose IDs exist in a ID list.
